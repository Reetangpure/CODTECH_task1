OVERVIEW THE PROJECT data analytucs
Overview of the ProjectProject: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on World Population DatasetObjectiveThe objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing population data from 1970 to 2022 for countries around the world. The aim is to uncover insights into population trends, distributions, correlations, and outliers through visualizations.Key ActivitiesData Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistencies and missing values.Data Visualization: Creating visualizations to understand data distributions, trends, and relationships.Correlation Analysis: Identifying correlations between population figures across different years.Technologies UsedPython: The primary programming language for data analysis.pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.matplotlib and seaborn: Used for creating visualizations and plotting data.NumPy: Used for numerical operations on data arrays.This project will involve cleaning and preprocessing the data, creating visualizations to reveal patterns, and analyzing correlations to derive meaningful insights into the world population trends over the specified period.
